# MamaRezepte Project Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully restructured the MamaRezepte project to use a FastAPI backend with SQLite database, implementing recursive recipe support.

## Backend Structure Improvements

### New Organized Structure

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py                 # FastAPI application entry point
│   ├── api/                    # API route handlers
│   │   ├── recipes.py          # Recipe endpoints
│   │   └── tags.py             # Tag endpoints
│   ├── core/                   # Core functionality
│   │   ├── config.py           # Configuration settings
│   │   └── database.py         # Database operations
│   └── models/                 # Pydantic models
│       └── schemas.py          # Request/Response models
└── data/                       # Database storage (persistent volume)
```

### Database Schema

- **recipes**: Main recipe information with recursive parent-child relationships
- **ingredients**: Properly structured ingredient data with amounts, units, and names
- **tags**: Recipe categorization system
- **recipe_tags**: Many-to-many relationship between recipes and tags

## Frontend Integration

### API Service

- Created `/src/services/api.js` for centralized API communication
- Environment variable support for API URL (`VITE_API_URL`)
- Proper error handling and response formatting

### Enhanced Recipe Display

- **Recursive Recipe Support**: Parent recipes (like Pizza) now display child recipes (like Pizzateig, Pizzasauce) with separate sections
- **Organized Ingredients**: Ingredients are properly formatted with amounts, units, and names
- **Structured Instructions**: Clear separation between main recipe and sub-recipe instructions
- **Tag Display**: Visual tag system for recipe categorization
- **Navigation**: Click-through support for parent-child recipe relationships

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Recursive Recipe Structure

- Parent recipes display child recipes as sub-sections
- Child recipes show their parent recipe with navigation links
- Ingredients and instructions are clearly separated by recipe level

#### 2. Enhanced Data Display

- Properly formatted ingredients (amount + unit + name)
- Visual tag system for recipe categories
- Improved ingredient parsing from the original underscore format

#### 3. API Integration

- All frontend components now use the FastAPI backend
- Real-time data loading from SQLite database
- Support for future CRUD operations

## Docker Integration

### Updated docker-compose.yml

- Backend service with persistent data volume
- Environment variable passing for API URLs
- Proper service dependencies (frontend depends on backend)
- Development and production profiles

### Dockerfile Improvements

- Automatic database initialization
- Proper Python environment setup
- Development vs production configurations

## Available Commands

````bash
# Development
make dev                # Start development environment
## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
make dev               # Start development environment

# Production
make up                # Start production environment
make build             # Build all Docker images

# Maintenance
make down              # Stop all containers
make clean             # Clean up containers and images
make logs              # Show logs
````

## Example Recursive Recipe Structure

### Pizza Salami (Parent Recipe)

- **Ingredients (Hauptrezept)**: Mozzarella, Parmesan, Salami, etc.
- **Unterrezepte**:
  - **Pizzateig**: Complete ingredient list and instructions
  - **Pizzasauce**: Complete ingredient list and instructions
- **Zubereitung (Hauptrezept)**: Assembly and baking instructions

This structure allows users to see the complete pizza recipe with all sub-components clearly organized, making complex recipes much easier to follow.

## Next Steps

The foundation is now in place for:

1. Adding recipe management UI (create, edit, delete)
2. Enhanced tag management
3. Recipe search and filtering by tags
4. Image upload functionality
5. User authentication and personal recipe collections
